Google_search_Data

This project analyzes Google search trends related to Cloud Computing, Data Science, and Machine Learning using the pytrends API (an unofficial Google Trends Python library). It provides insights into public interest by region and over time, along with comparative analysis among these popular technology topics.

The goal of this project is to:

Track how interest in cloud computing has evolved globally over the past 12 months.

Identify the top countries showing interest in cloud computing.

Compare cloud computing with data science and machine learning based on Google search interest over time.
Key Features:

1.Interest by Region
Visualized a bar chart of the top 15 countries searching for “Cloud Computing”.
Displayed a choropleth world map to show regional interest levels.

2.Interest Over Time
Created a line chart showing how search interest in “Cloud Computing” changes month by month over the past year.

3.Keyword Comparison
Compared search interest trends for:

Cloud Computing

Data Science

Machine Learning

Plotted all three on a single timeline for visual comparison.
